// react-native-audio-api implements the same specification, so the phone
// build should be able to stand in for this module rather than replace
// it. Nothing here knows about the DOM, and nothing here knows about
// music theory — it is handed pitches and told when to sound them.

// the high end — which is exactly what a real string does, and why the
// result sounds plucked rather than synthesised.

// It is rendered into a buffer rather than built from nodes because a
// feedback loop in the Web Audio graph cannot be shorter than one render
// quantum (128 samples). That puts a ceiling around 375Hz, which would
// lose the top two octaves of the neck — most of where a scale run goes.

  // so being one sample out is a third of a semitone. The fix is to let
  // the delay be fractional — read between two samples and mix them in
